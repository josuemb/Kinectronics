## A Mechatronics-Kinect Programming API

Have you tried programming software that involves gesture detection with **Kinect**? Do you know how much effort and time does this task require? Are you interested on controling **mechatronical** or **robotic** devices with Kinect but you are wasting too much time trying to understand how Kinect works instead of developing your devices's algorithms?

If your answer to any of these questions was "yes", then you have found a piece of gold right here.

**Kinectronics** is an **API** thought for those developers who want to invest time most in the logic of their projects instead of using it for understanding Kinect technology. Is kind of a **"plug-and-play"** app meant to make the use of Microsoft's Kinect Sensor with **gesture recognition** easier.

### Object Oriented

- **Kinectronics** is written in **C#**, an **Object Oriented** programming language developed by Microsoft. Its use is easy to integrate with any kind of **.NET Framework** based technology.
- It is easy to create different objects of different mechatronical devices, ready for data accesing and in-app use.
- As its nature is being an API (library for this matter), it can be easily added as a reference in any C# project.

### Gesture Database Defined

- For saving time in Kinect Gesture Recognition project development, a functional Gesture Detection database has been already created. With all the invested time for training that doing it requires.
- Contains 12 arms gestures defined, ready for acces in app development. 
- Thought to make the control feel natural, the gestures are pretty intuitive. The user will feel like is using "the force" to control devices.

*Different databases are planned to be uploaded for further applications.

### Common Mechatronical Devices Included

- Contains several objects corresponding to different mechatronical devices such as drones, automoviles, robotic arms, bulldozers and much more, ready to be used for developers.
- Contains already open source working APIs for these devices, for your comfort and peace. We already have done the hard work.

### Devices Security

- We know how much money can cost mechatronical and robotic devices. That is why we have taken care of their security by developing an algorithm that is capable of putting your device in a security state if the control is lost.

### Made With Love

As Kinect Developers, we are aware on how much time it has to be invested in order to make Kinect work the way we want. It implies dozens of hours of reading and analysis for understanding the sensors's API logic. That is why this project was built, for you to spend your time in a more productive way. This project is the synthesis of three years of hard work in Kinect development. 

Please, **enjoy it** and let us know if we can improve the project in any way. Also, feel free to contribute to the project as it is an Open Source one. For any questions and comments, just contact us. 

**NOTE**: the project is still in development, it has already been tested and it works as it supposed to do, but there is still a lot of work to be done, bugs and failures to be corrected and code to be improved. Be pacient.
